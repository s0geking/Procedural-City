# Procedural-City
A project where I followed a tutorial on how to procedurally create a city in Unity. I then add the ability to procedurally generate a park in the middle.

The scripts included are a mix of code original to me and code from the tutorial that I followed. All of it was type by my though so it follows my coding style
